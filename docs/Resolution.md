# Resolution

### Solvers
The API has been built to wrap a large panel of  Traveling Salesman Problem(TSP) and Vehicle Routing Problem(VRP) constraints in order to call the most fitted solvers.

The currently integreted solvers are:

* **[Vroom](https://github.com/VROOM-Project/vroom)** only handle the basic Traveling Salesman Problem.
* **[OR-Tools](https://github.com/google/or-tools)** handle multiple vehicles, timewindows, quantities, skills and lateness.
* **[Jsprit](https://github.com/graphhopper/jsprit)** handle multiple vehicles, timewindows, quantities, skills and setup duration. (Not used @Mapotempo)

### Asserts

In order to select which solver will be used, we have created several assert. If the conditions are satisfied, the solver called can be used.

* **assert_at_least_one_mission** :
 *OR-Tools, Vroom*. The VRP has at least one service or one shipment.

 *Vroom*. The Vehicles have no timewindow or have a cost_late_multiplier strictly superior to 0.
* **assert_vehicles_no_force_start** :
 The Vehicles have no start forced.
* **assert_vehicles_no_late_multiplier** :
 The Vehicles have no late multiplier cost.

 *OR-Tools*. The Zones have at most one alternative allocation.

### Solve

The current API can handle multiple particular behaviors. **first_solution_strategy** parameter forces a particular behavior in order to find first solution. In the remainder, \'a\', \'b\' and \'c\' are heuristic names.
Currently, 8 heuristics are available with ORtools :

* **path_cheapest_arc** : Connect start node to the node which produces the cheapest route segment, then extend the route by iterating on the last node added to the route.
* **global_cheapest_arc** : Iteratively connect two nodes which produce the cheapest route segment.
* **local_cheapest_insertion** : Insert nodes at their cheapest position.
* **savings** : The savings value is the difference between the cost of two routes visiting one node each and one route visiting both nodes.
* **parallel_cheapest_insertion** : Insert nodes at their cheapest position on any route; potentially several routes can be built in parallel.
* **first_unbound : First unbound minimum value** : Select the first node with an unbound successor and connect it to the first available node (default).
* **christofides** : Extends route until no nodes can be inserted on it.
* **periodic** : Heuristic for problems with periodicity.

Currently, 3 behaviors are available with **first_solution_strategy** :

* **\'a,b,c\'** : Test these heuristics and provide to full resolution the one which provided the best solution. There should be at least 2 and at most 3 heuristics provided. periodic heuristic should not be used in this case since it is not applied
on the same category of problems.
* **\'self_selection\'** : Same as previous, but list is an internal selection of heuristics.
* **\'a\'** : Forces the solver to use this specific heuristic.
