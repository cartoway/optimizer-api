# Schedule Optimization

### Problem definition

---

The plan must be described in its general way, the schedule duration the begin and end days or indices.
Some day may have to be exclude from the resolution, like holiday, and could be defined by its days or indices.

```json
{
  "configuration": {
    "preprocessing": {
      "prefer_short_segment": true
    },
    "resolution": {
      "duration": 1000,
      "iterations_without_improvment": 100
    },
    "schedule": {
      "range_indices": {
        "start": 0,
        "end": 13
      },
      "unavailable_indices": [2]
    }
  }
}
```

### Vehicle definition

---

The timewindows of a vehicle over a week can be defined with an array using **sequence_timewindows** instead of a single timewindow.
To link a timewindow with a week day, a **day_index can** be set (from 0 [monday] to 6 [sunday]). Those time slot will repeated over the entire period for every week contained.
As at the problem definition level, some days could be unavailable to a specific vehicle, this can be defined with **unavailable_work_date** or **unavailable_work_day_indices**

```json
{
  "id": "vehicle_id-1",
  "router_mode": "car",
  "router_dimension": "time",
  "speed_multiplier": 1.0,
  "sequence_timewindows": [{
    "day_index": 0,
    "start": 25200,
    "end": 57600
  }, {
    "day_index": 1,
    "start": 25200,
    "end": 57600
  }, {
    "day_index": 2,
    "start": 25200,
    "end": 57600
  }, {
    "day_index": 3,
    "start": 25200,
    "end": 57600
  }, {
    "day_index": 4,
    "start": 25200,
    "end": 57600
  }],
  "start_point_id": "store",
  "end_point_id": "store",
  "unavailable_work_day_indices": [5, 7]
}
```

### Services definition

---

As the vehicles, services have period defined timewindows, using **day_index** parameter within its timewindows. And some days could be not available to deliver a customer, which can be defined with **unavailable_visit_day_indices** or **unavailable_visit_day_date**
Some visits could be avoided because it is not mandatory, or any particular reason, **unavailable_visit_indices** allow to not include a particular visit over the period.
To define multiple visit of a customer over the period, you can set it through the **visits_number** field.
By default, it will divide the period by the number of visits in order to non overlap the multiple visits.

```json
{
  "id": "visit-1",
  "activity": {
    "point_id": "visit-point-1",
    "timewindows": [{
      "day_index": 0,
      "start": 28800,
      "end": 64800
    }, {
      "day_index": 0,
      "start": 61200,
      "end": 97200
    }, {
      "day_index": 2,
      "start": 28800,
      "end": 64800
    }, {
      "day_index": 3,
      "start": 28800,
      "end": 64800
    }, {
      "day_index": 4,
      "start": 28800,
      "end": 64800
    }],
    "duration": 1200.0
  },
  "visits_number": 2
}
```

N.B: Shipments are currently not available within the schedule optimisation

### Additional parameters

---

**Minimum/Maximum Lapse**
Between to visits of the same mission, it could be necessary to determine exactly the lapse. At this purpose, the **minimum_lapse** and **maximum_lapse** fields of services are available.

```json
{
  "id": "visit-1",
  "activity": {
    "point_id": "visit-point-1",
    "timewindows": [{
      "day_index": 0,
      "start": 28800,
      "end": 64800
    }, {
      "day_index": 0,
      "start": 61200,
      "end": 97200
    }, {
      "day_index": 2,
      "start": 28800,
      "end": 64800
    }, {
      "day_index": 3,
      "start": 28800,
      "end": 64800
    }, {
      "day_index": 4,
      "start": 28800,
      "end": 64800
    }],
    "duration": 1200.0
  },
  "visits_number": 2,
  "minimum_lapse": 7,
  "maximum_lapse": 14
}
```
