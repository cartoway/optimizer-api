# Skills

Some package must be carried by some particular vehicle, or some points can only be visited by some particular vehicle or driver. Skills allow to represent those kind of constraints.
A vehicle can carry the **services** or **shipments** with the defined **skills** and the ones which have none or part of the current vehicle skills.

```json
  "vehicles": [{
    "id": "vehicle_id",
    "router_mode": "car",
    "router_dimension": "time",
    "speed_multiplier": 1.0,
    "start_point_id": "vehicle-start",
    "end_point_id": "vehicle-end",
    "skills": [
        ["frozen"]
      ],
    "cost_fixed": 0.0,
    "cost_distance_multiplier": 0.0,
    "cost_time_multiplier": 1.0
  }]
```

Missions must be carried by a vehicle which have at least all the required skills by the current service or shipment.

```json
  "services": [{
    "id": "visit",
    "activity": {
      "point_id": "visit-point-1",
      "timewindows": [{
        "start": 3600,
        "end": 4800
      }],
      "duration": 2100.0
    },
    "skills": ["frozen"]
  }
```

Some vehicles can change its **skills** once empty, passing from one configuration to another. Here passing from a configuration it can carry only cool products from another it can only tool frozen ones and vice versa.
