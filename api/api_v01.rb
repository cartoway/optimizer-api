      description: ('<h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>
        The API has been build in order to call multiple VRP solver in order to cover a large panel of constraints.
        </p>

        <p>The currently integreted solvers are :
          <ul>
            <li> <a href="https://github.com/VROOM-Project/vroom">Vroom</a> handle only the basic TSP</li>
            <li> <a href="https://github.com/google/or-tools">ORtools</a> handle multiple vehicles, timewindows, quantities, skills and lateness</li>
            <li> <a href="https://github.com/graphhopper/jsprit">Jsprit</a> handle multiple vehicles, timewindows, quantities, skills and setup duration</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Before calling those libraries, a VRP model must be defined, which is decomposed in a few main principles
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Vehicles : Describe the features of the existing or supposed vehicles</li>
            <li>Services and Shipments : Describe the activities to be performed into the VRP, its special features</li>
            <li>Points : Represent a point in space, it could call a matrix index or be self defined as latitude and longitude coordinates</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p> Some Structures are related to the above ones, in order to describe the API behavior
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Matrices : Describe the topology of the problem, could of time or distance, depending of the constraints, could be build using the router wrapper</li>
            <li>Units : Describe the dimension used by the good carried</li>
            <li>Capacities : Defined the limit of place allow for a unit into the vehicle</li>
            <li>Quantities : Give the place taken by a package into the vehicle capacity</li>
            <li>Activities : Describe where take place an activity, when it could be performed and how long it last</li>
            <li>Rests : Inform about the in route break of the vehicles</li>
            <li>TimeWindows : Defined a time interval where activities could be performed</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>The Vrp model carry its own parameters, which could be used depending on the used solver or the requirements</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>VROOM : It requires any parameters and stop by itself</li>
            <li>ORtools : Could take a maximum solve duration, or can stop by itself depending on the solve state as a time-out between two new best solution, or a number of iterations without improvement</li>
            <li>Jsprit : Could take a maximum solve duration, a number of iterations wihtout improvment or a number of iteration without variation in the neighborhood search</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
