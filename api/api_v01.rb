      description: ('<h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>
        The API has been build in order to call multiple VRP solver in order to cover a large panel of constraints.
        </p>

        <p>The currently integreted solvers are :
          <ul>
            <li> <b><a href="https://github.com/VROOM-Project/vroom">Vroom</a></b> handle only the basic TSP.</li>
            <li> <b><a href="https://github.com/google/or-tools">ORtools</a></b> handle multiple vehicles, timewindows, quantities, skills and lateness.</li>
            <li> <b><a href="https://github.com/graphhopper/jsprit">Jsprit</a></b> handle multiple vehicles, timewindows, quantities, skills and setup duration.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Before calling those libraries, a VRP model must be defined, which is decomposed in a few main principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Vehicles</b> : Describe the features of the existing or supposed vehicles.</li>
            <li><b>Services and Shipments</b> : Describe the activities to be performed into the VRP, its special features.</li>
            <li><b>Points</b> : Represent a point in space, it could call a matrix index or be self defined as latitude and longitude coordinates.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p> Some Structures are related to the above ones, in order to describe the API behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Matrices</b> : Describe the topology of the problem, could of time or distance, depending of the constraints, could be build using the router wrapper.</li>
            <li><b>Units</b> : Describe the dimension used by the good carried.</li>
            <li><b>Capacities</b> : Define the limit of place allow for a unit into the vehicle.</li>
            <li><b>Quantities</b> : Give the place taken by a package into the vehicle capacity.</li>
            <li><b>Activities</b> : Describe where take place an activity, when it could be performed and how long it last.</li>
            <li><b>Rests</b> : Inform about the in route break of the vehicles.</li>
            <li><b>TimeWindows</b> : Define a time interval where activities could be performed.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>The Vrp model carry its own parameters, which could be used depending on the called solver or the targeted result.</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>VROOM</b> : It requires no parameters and stops by itself.</li>
            <li><b>ORtools</b> : Could take a maximum solve duration, or can stop by itself depending on the solve state as a time-out between two new best solution, or a number of iterations without improvement.</li>
            <li><b>Jsprit</b> : Could take a maximum solve duration, a number of iterations wihtout improvment or a number of iteration without variation in the neighborhood search.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
